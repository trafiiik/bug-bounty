# bug-bounty

This is my personnal bug bounty repo where I put the tools I use and methodologies.

It's also where I put my personnal experience with bug bounties. With what I struggled and what I found interesting.

Note that some info may be wrong or incorrect since I am still exploring this domain.

## Platforms

## Avoid
* Exhausting yourself with AI. Yes AI is OP to generate payloads and check things quickly but it shouldn't replace you. I found that if I relied on it too much, I quickly got exhausted as everything it said wasn't applicable.
* Relying solely on automatic tools.
* Not giving any POC when writing a report.


## Do
* Manually check for things
* Be very patient
* Take breaks
* Switch programs if you feel that you ran out of ideas on the program you're currently working on. You can comeback to that program next time.
* **Take notes**

### Taking notes

From what I've experienced so far, this is very important.

I've neglected taking real notes of what I am trying to exploit, remarks, fails etc..

I am using Obsidian for note taking as I find it gives you to ability to organize notes of different programs quite easily.

Taking notes also helps you process what you've done, what worked and what didn't so it can greatly help you find a bug and it gets you unstuck.

I am currently only doing web bug bounties.
