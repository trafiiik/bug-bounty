# bug-bounty

This is my personnal bug bounty repo where I put the tools I use and methodologies.

It's also where I put my personnal experience with bug bounties. With what I struggled and what I found interesting.

Some stuff may be wrong or incorrect since I am still exploring this domain.

## Platforms

**I am on Intigriti**

## Avoid
* Exhausting yourself with AI. Yes AI is OP to generate payloads and check things quick but it shouldn't replace you. I found that if I relied on it too much, I got exhausted quickly as everything it said wasn't applicable.
* Relying solely on automatic tools.
* Not giving any POC when writing a report.


## Do
* Manually check for things
* Be very patient
* Take breaks
* Switch programs if you feel that you ran out of ideas on the program you're currently working on. You can comeback to that program next time.
* Take notes of what could be vulnerable

I am currently only doing web bug bounties.

## Web 

* ffuf
* gobuster
* BurpSuite
